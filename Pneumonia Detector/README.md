## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rupayan2005/ML-Project.git
cd Pneumonia Detector
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Model Files

Ensure you have the following files in the `model/` directory:
- `pneumonia_classifier.h5` - Pre-trained model weights
- `labels.txt` - Class labels file

## üéØ Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Using the Interface

1. **Upload Image**: Click on the file uploader and select a chest X-ray image (PNG, JPG, or JPEG)
2. **Wait for Analysis**: The AI model will process the image automatically
3. **View Results**: See the diagnosis result with confidence score
4. **Interpret Results**: Review the confidence level and any warnings
